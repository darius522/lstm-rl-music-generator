# lstm-rl-music-generator
This project aims at combining DNN and RL for musical purposes. It is inspired by the magenta paper/implmentation:
*"Tuning Recurrent Neural Networks with Reinforcement Learning"*

The ultimate goal would be to propose a plain/vanilla version of it, which would offer much simpler and adaptable code.
